# Perceptron Model for AND Gate

This project implements a single-layer Perceptron neural network to simulate
an AND logic gate. The model is trained until convergence and visualized
using Matplotlib.

## Features
- Perceptron with bias
- Epoch-wise training output
- Decision boundary visualization
- Error vs Epoch graph

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.0
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage
The perceptron is trained on AND gate inputs.
After each epoch:
- Outputs are printed in table format
- Decision boundary is updated
- Correct and incorrect points are shown

## Output
- Epoch-wise weight updates
- Decision boundary visualization
- Final error vs epoch plot
